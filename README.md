# My Own Programming Language

Welcome to my custom programming language, inspired by BASIC and developed using Python. This project includes a Lexer for tokenizing input, an Error Handler for robust debugging, and a Parser to create an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The code structure is designed to be readable and maintainable.

## Features

- **Lexer**: Tokenizes input to facilitate parsing.
- **Error Handler**: Provides robust debugging to identify and handle errors effectively.
- **Parser**: Creates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for syntactic analysis.
- **Enhanced Code Structure**: Ensures readability and maintainability of the codebase.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/risav-pyakurel/My-own-programming-Languagee.git
   cd My-own-programming-Languagee
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies (if any). For example:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

To run the lexer, parser, and interpreter, use the following commands:

```bash
python main.py
```

You can input your custom programming language code in the provided interface. The lexer will tokenize the input, the parser will generate an AST, and the interpreter will execute the code.

### Example

Here's an example of how to use the language:

```basic
LET A = 10
PRINT A
```
